# Projetc_Feminicide

## Project based in real statics about the femicide in Sao Paulo City.

The Feminicide Dashboard has the function of showing how areas of São Paulo are affected by abusive crimes against women, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In 2022 alone, 3,913 women were killed in the country. Of these, 1,350 were victims of feminicide, that is, of murders committed due to their female gender status. The state of São Paulo is one of the states with the highest recurrent increase in feminicide, an alarming problem, however. With the use of technologies and the correct data, we can find a solution that can control this very problematic situation.

The purpose of the dashboard is to demonstrate to everyone in an intuitive way the big problem that is feminicide, by visualizing the correct metrics you can have much more clarity about the impact of this problem on our society
